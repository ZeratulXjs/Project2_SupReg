# Machine Learning Practice Project 2 

### This is a project to help me practice the application of various linear regression models with regularization

This project uses the publically available **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** hosted on 
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset]

I intend to apply the steps taught in the last 3 weeks ie;

1. Data retrieval
2. Data cleaning (removing/imputing missing values and outliers)
3. Checking features using plots/ visualisations
4. Feature engineering such as transformations for linear regression modelling
5. Application of linear regression, Ridge regression and LASSO regression on scaled and unscaled data
6. Comparison of regularization effects on variance through elimiation of features (reduction to zero)
7. Comparison of R2 scores to determine which model has the best predictive power
